# USOM
USOM (Untitled Student Organization Manager) is a student organization manager developed in 12 hours by Will Knospe and Adam Kral
for a hackathon at Carleton College. USOM was developed to specifications from Carleton's Information Technology Services department in order to provide students with an easy way organizing clubs 
and organizations online, allowing them to organize leaders, members and events, as well as enabling emailing the entire
club with a single click and interfacing with Carleton's student directory to retrieve profile pictures. The project recieved second place in the hackathon.
